## HTTP Status Codes

### General information

First, we created handler functions for the GET and POST requests that will be received and set the status code on the server response to the appropriate status code. Now that we have  simple handler functions, we can invoke them when GET and POST requests are received. Next, we passed the req and res variables from the .createServer() callback into the handler functions as the first and second arguments, respectively.
